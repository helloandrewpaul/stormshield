# Stormshield

Stormshield is a cybersecurity company that provides solutions and products for various industries and sectors.

**1. Social Engineering Attacks**: The health crisis, remote work, and vaccination efforts have increased cybercriminals' interest in social engineering attacks. Scammers personalize phishing emails using health topics, teleworking tools, and delivery announcements to increase their effectiveness.

**2. Ransomware**: Ransomware attacks have intensified, particularly affecting the health and public services sectors. Attackers are now putting additional pressure on organizations by publishing stolen data, which is a common tactic against the health sector worldwide.

**3. Threats Against Publishers**: Supply chain attacks, such as the SolarWinds incident, remain a significant threat. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in IT vendors' software, causing cascades of insecurity and compromising entire sectors of the economy or government.

**4. Security Products Under Attack**: There is a growing trend of cybercriminals targeting security solutions themselves. By compromising security products, attackers gain access to critical parts of organizations' information systems. Cybersecurity companies must develop more robust protection for their products to counter this threat effectively.

**5. Ideal Target Employees**: Certain employee profiles are particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks, including technical specialists, service providers, IT managers, employees in financial departments, and company managers.

**6. Future Outlook**: Cyber threats are expected to continue evolving, with attackers becoming more creative and organizations needing to continually reinforce their cybersecurity measures.

Stormshield offers various cybersecurity solutions, including endpoint security, network security, data security, and security monitoring, to help organizations protect themselves against these evolving cyber threats.
